Make an order through API CowSwap

## Setup & Installation

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source ./env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will need to create your own `.env` file. A template exists here as `.env.sample`
from which you can make your own by running the command `cp .env.sample .env` and
filling in your own account details.

## Placing an Order

Set your network and private key in `.env`.

Fill the variables in the `cow_swap` method of `./main.py`

```shell
src .env
python -m src.main
```

If you run the script exactly as is with the public and private keys provided, you
should receive an error from the orderbook API saying:

```shell
{"errorType":"InsufficientFunds","description":"order owner must have funds worth at least x in his account"}
```

# CowSwap API Integrations & Tid Bits

A collection of python scripts and services built as simple integrations
with [Gnosis Protocol v2](https://gnosis.io/protocol/)

## [WIP] Trading Bot for Stable Coin Orders

Initially inspired by [Martin's script](https://pastebin.com/RZyfL08P). This integration
is a simple bot which monitors the orderbook seeking open orders
between [stable coins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stablecoin). Assuming that, on
average, USD stable coins are worth 1 USD, the bot is prepared to place a counter order
for any swap willing to trade `x` of token A for `y` of token B when `x < y`. It is
important to remember that execution fees must be factored into this decision-making
process so that the counter order placed should net a result of strictly more tokens
purchased than sold (including fees).

For this reason, the script is primarily intended to be run on xDai network where
transaction fees are negligible.

To see the trading history of the bot currently running on xDai with this script check

## [TODO] LP Token Solver

Design an HTTP solver which allow people to "swap"
[LP tokens](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens)

In essence, the solver will fetch the open orderbook, filtering for orders whose buy or
sell token is an LP token. It will then encode the interactions necessary to enter or
exit liquidity from the corresponding pool.

### Advanced features

In the event that there is a
[coincidence of wants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence_of_wants)
(a.k.a. a *CoW*), the solver could match the orders directly to reduce the cost of
execution. Note that, A CoW in this scenario corresponds to a simultaneous desire to
provide and withdraw liquidity from a specific pool.
